description: A few notes to get you started with Etterna and tweaktown
---

# For new players

Q: How do I install tweaktown?

A: [**Download the latest version here**](https://github.com/joleskins/tweaktown/releases) and extract the **`tweaktown`** folder to **`Etterna\Themes`**. Then in etterna, go to **`Options->Display Options->Appearance Options->Theme`** and select tweaktown



Q: How do I go back to Etterna's default theme?

A: From the main menu, go to **`Settings->Graphics`** and choose **`Rebirth`** at the top &#x20;



Q: How do I change my scroll speed?

A: In song select, either **`Press enter twice`**, press the **`Setup button`** next to Preview or press **`Backspace`**. The top option **`C400`** is your scroll speed. If you're coming from osu!mania, you can estimate your scroll speed by **multiplying your osu!mania speed by 32**. Normally you would have to adjust scroll speed depending on receptor size, but tweaktown takes care of scaling it for you.



Q: Where do I get noteskins?

A:[ Skins can be downloaded from here](https://etternaonline.com/customisation/noteskins), and if you're playing 4k/6k, they need to be extracted to **`Etterna\NoteSkins\dance`**. Other keymodes go in different folders like so: 5k=pump, 7k=kb7, 7+1k=beat\
