# For noteskinners

hello, this is for noteskin lua nerds so if you're just doing png swaps then don't worry about it

if your noteskin relies on playerConfig stuff from regular Til Death then take note of this

in playerConfig, "NotefieldX" and "NotefieldY" are renamed to "NoteFieldX" and "NoteFieldY", so make an exception checking for both if you want your skin to be compatible with both Til Death and tweaktown. this was changed while making the notefield draggable. not sure if i'll keep this note here forever but it's worth having it written right after this happened, thanks for coming to my ted talk



in the future maybe you can tell the theme to hide specific things during gameplay with a simple table in your noteskin containing element names(not working yet, coming one day™️)
