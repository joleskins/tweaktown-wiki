## **This theme requires specific game settings and a 16:9 window resolution.**

Insert list of required settings here or something idk

~~If you're worried about not being able to play with your preferred resolution, there is a way to get the same playing experience on 16:9 if you're using windowed mode.~~

~~Close the game and edit **`DisplayHeight`** in **`Etterna/Save/Preferences.ini`** to match the resolution you're used to. For example, if you're used to **`800x600`**, do **`DisplayHeight=600`**~~

~~The height will be set to whatever you put, and width auto adjusts to match 16:9. Using the height you're used to should feel the same while playing.~~

~~If you're using fullscreen and not 16:9, you'll have to wait for other theme versions.~~





Yes, versions for other aspect ratios are planned. The resolution is limited to make skinning more flexible because the position and scale of elements can stay consistent this way.

Only 16:9 will be supported to start with while things get adjusted and bugs get fixed. After this version is stable and polished, 4:3 and 16:10 are next in line
