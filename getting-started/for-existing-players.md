description: Differences between tweaktown and existing themes(Rebirth, Til Death)
---

# For existing players

While this theme may look new on the surface, it really is just a glorified Til Death edit, so functionally and navigation should feel familiar if you've used that theme before. &#x20;

However, there are still some differences that may be useful to know.



1. Scroll speed is automatically adjusted to account for receptor size changes. This means no matter your receptor size, the scroll speed stays the same. If your receptor size isn't 100%, you can use this formula to get your usual speed back: **`CMod*(receptor_size/100)`**.\
   Example: **`C800 80% Receptor Size`** -> **`C800*0.8=C640`**<br>
2. Downscroll is now default and receptors sit lower on the screen by default(Higher if upscroll). This can be reverted with playfield position in customize gameplay<br>
3. Each keymode now has separate defaults in customize gameplay so they don't look weird for the most part. It's not perfect since it depends on keycount, so dance double(8K) shares the same settings as beat(7+1K), but at least it's better than before <br>
4. In song select, either **`Press enter twice`**, press the **`Setup button`** next to Preview, or press **`Backspace`** to access player options. Don't be fooled by the setup/backspace overlay - you still need to choose "Apply" at the bottom for settings to save. Pressing escape won't keep your changes<br>
5. Help key in song select has been moved. **`F12`**->**`F1`**<br>
6. You can now adjust volume with **`Alt + Scroll or Up/down arrow keys`**<br>
7. Midgrades are not directly supported by the theme. If you have them on, there won't be any visual difference. The only exception is when sorting by grades where you can see all of them.<br>
8. A lot of options have been removed for the sake of decluttering. Particularly some very, very niche gimmick mods, legacy settings and duplicates were taken out so the options are easier to navigate<br>
9. On top of removing options, a lot of them have been renamed and reordered for ease of navigation and knowing what settings actually do. Player options should feel familiar, but main menu options are fairly different. Ideally there would be an entirely new options screen, but surely that'll never be a thing... unless? 👀
